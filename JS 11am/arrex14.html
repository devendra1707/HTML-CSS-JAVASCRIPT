Sometimes you may need to take an array and apply some procedure to its elements so that you get a new array with modified elements.

Instead of manually iterating over the array using a loop, you can simply use the built-in Array.map() method.

The Array.map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the array's elements.

let circles = [ 10, 20, 30 ];

let areas = [];  // to store areas of circles
let area = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < circles.length; i++) {
    area = PI * circles[i] **2 ;
    areas.push(area);
}
 
let areas = circles.map(function(radius){ return PI * radius **2; });


let numbers = [16, 25, 36];
let results = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);
